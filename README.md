# quantitative-bias-analysis-Stata-code-example

Stata code for quantative bias analysis. 
This code has been applied in the paper "Could differential under-reporting of loneliness between men and women bias the gender-specific association between loneliness duration and rate of memory decline? A probabilistic bias analysis of effect modification on the additive scale"

Here, we provide example Stata code to calculate the simulation estimates and intervals for the three-way interaction term between loneliness duration, years of follow-up, and gender, with sensitivity values following a trapezoidal distribution between 0.25 and 0.30 among men and 0.35-0.40 among women, and specificity values were constantly hold at 0.92-1.00 for both genders with a trapezoidal distribution.
